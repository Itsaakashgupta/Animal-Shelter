An end-to-end analytics project built using **Power BI** and **ZoomCharts**, focused on understanding animal shelter operations and generating **data-driven insights** to improve save rates, reduce length of stay (LOS), and support operational decision-making.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Animal shelters operate under capacity, staffing, and time constraints.  
This project analyzes **animal intake and outcome data** to identify operational patterns, performance gaps, and improvement opportunities related to:

- Intake volume & seasonality
- Adoption and live-release performance
- Length of stay (LOS)
- Repeat intakes
- Resource and prevention strategies

The goal is to move beyond reporting and deliver **actionable insights** that support animal welfare and shelter efficiency.

## 📂 Dataset Description

**Source:**  
City of Long Beach Animal Care Services (via DataDNA / ZoomCharts Challenge)

### What the dataset represents
Each record corresponds to an **animal intake event**, capturing the full lifecycle of an animal’s shelter stay—from intake to outcome.

### Key attributes include:
- **Animal Details:** Species, breed, age, sex, color
- **Intake Information:** Intake date, intake type, intake condition, intake source
- **Outcome Information:** Outcome type, outcome date, live-release indicators
- **Operational Fields:** Length of stay, current resident status

This structure enables **longitudinal analysis**, including repeat intakes.

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Cleaning

Significant preparation was required to ensure analytical accuracy.

### Key steps performed:
- Parsed and standardized **date fields** (DOB, intake date, outcome date)
- Corrected **negative or invalid age values**
- Handled missing DOB values safely
- Cleaned and standardized **text fields**
- Replaced missing categorical values (e.g., secondary color)
- Created a **standardized outcome classification** to simplify analysis

These steps ensured the data was **consistent, reliable, and visualization-ready**.

---

## 🔧 Data Transformation & Feature Engineering

To support deeper analysis, several calculated fields and measures were created.

### Key transformations:
- **Age at Intake** (calculated with validation)
- **Age Groups** (Baby, Young, Adult, Senior)
- **Length of Stay (LOS)**  
  - Includes animals still in shelter
- **Live Release Rate (LRR)**  
  - Excludes current residents from denominator
- **Repeat Intake Flag**  
  - Identifies animals with multiple intake records
- **Calendar Table**  
  - Enables YoY, monthly, and weekday analysis

These transformations enabled accurate KPIs and operational insights.

## 📊 Dashboard & Analysis Highlights

The Power BI report answers key operational questions such as:

- How do intakes and outcomes vary over time?
- Are there seasonal or weekday intake patterns?
- Which species, age groups, or conditions drive long LOS?
- Which intake sources contribute most to volume?
- Which animals are at risk of repeat intake?
- What actions could improve save rates and reduce LOS?

Interactive visuals were built using **ZoomCharts** to support:
- Drill-down exploration
- Cross-filtering
- Intuitive navigation for business users

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Intakes peak during **summer months** and mid-week, enabling proactive staffing plans
- **Cat intakes surge in summer**, driving longer LOS compared to dogs
- Adoption rates have improved significantly over time, but **live-release rates fluctuate**
- **Age, species, intake condition, and outcome type** strongly influence LOS
- Repeat intakes are concentrated in specific outcome pathways, indicating prevention gaps

---

## 🎯 Data-Driven Recommendations

Based on the analysis, high-impact actions include:
- Seasonal foster and staffing expansion
- Targeted adoption campaigns for seniors and long-stay animals
- Medical fast-tracking for mild-condition cases
- Post-adoption and post–return-to-owner follow-up programs
- Community prevention initiatives focused on high-volume intake sources

## 🌱 Personal Learning & Growth

This project strengthened my skills in:
- Power BI data modeling and DAX
- KPI design grounded in business logic
- Analytical storytelling for decision-makers
- Using ZoomCharts for interactive insights
- Translating analysis into operational recommendations

Most importantly, it reinforced that **effective analytics is about driving decisions—not just building dashboards**.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how operational data can be transformed into **actionable insights** that improve animal welfare outcomes and optimize shelter operations.

It reflects a complete analytics workflow:
**data preparation → analysis → insight → recommendation**.
